# SOLID Principles

* Five agile principles that should guide you every time you need to write code.
1. Single Responsibility (SRP)
1. Open/Closed (OCP)
1. Liskov's Substitution 
1. Interface Segregation 
1. Dependency Inversion


### Single responsibility principle(SRP)
* A class should have only single responsibility.
* A Class should have only one reason to change.
* Yes, it is quite important for a class to have no more than one task.

### Open/closed principle(OCP)
* Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. 
```
Software entities: classes, modules, functions, etc.
```
* Write your code so that you will be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code.

* It uses interfaces instead of superclasses.


### Liskov substitution principle(LSP)
* Store any subclass reference into a base class variable and the behavior wonâ€™t change which is the goal of LSP.

* Child class objects should be able to replace parent class objects without compromising application integrity. 

* What this means essentially, is that we should put an effort to create such derived class objects which can replace objects of the base class without modifying its behavior.

* Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

* If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (in other words, objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, and so on).



### Interface segregation principle(ISP)
* The interface-segregation principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
 * Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.



### Dependency inversion principle(DIP)
* One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
* Both should depend on abstractions.
* Abstractions should not depend on details. * Details should depend on abstractions.

* So High-level and low-level modules And Details depends on Abstractions 

> High-level + Low-level modules + Details: Abstractions

* High-level modules: describe those operations in our application that has more abstract nature and contain more complex logic. These modules orchestrate low-level modules in our application.

* Low-level modules:  contain more specific individual components focusing on details and smaller parts of the application. These modules are used inside the high-level modules in our app.
